# Business-Analytics-and-Data-Science

This is the project I made for my Business analytics and Data science course at Humboldt university as a final assignment. I decided to update this project, since I upgraded my skills since then, and now I find quality of this work poor :upside_down_face:

Learning dataset, labeled: BADS_WS2021_known.csv

Unlabeled dataset on which a ML model should be applied to produce predictions: BADS_WS2021_unknown.csv

Jupyter notebok with the code and detailed description: 610816.ipynb
